I get your hardware ID for authentication - I cannot see it as far as I know.

However I do get to see your IP address - only in certain instances. This is used for IP bans if a user is bypassing the ban set on their account.

I am networking your head and hands position and rotation. I am also networking your microphone - you can disable the microphone on the prompt that appears first time you start the game.
